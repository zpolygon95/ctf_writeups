# Square CTF 2018 #

Found at [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org), Square's annual public CTF has a
Unix MAN page aesthetic that is very cool, and persistent hosing for past year's
events! Check out [squarectf.com](https://squarectf.com/2018) for a complete
list of problems, the story behind the problems, and for write-ups of the
problems that I didn't get to!

I seem to be getting at least marginally better at this, so hopefully the
writeups below are useful to somebody.

## Problems ##

+ [dot-n-dash](C1/README.md): A fun little encoding problem
+ [shredded](C3/README.md): [Exactly what you'd expect][1]
+ [captcha](C8/README.md): My white whale
