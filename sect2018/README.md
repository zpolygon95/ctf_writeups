# SEC-T CTF 2018 #

Found at [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org), this was a GHOST IN THE SHELL
themed public CTF put on by [SEC-T](https://www.sec-t.org). I only found two
flags (The easiest two!), and I was lucky to have managed that. Clearly, I have
a lot to learn!

I didn't get the chance to take a screenshot of the scoreboard before the site
went down, but I think some of that information might still be available on the
event's [page](https://ctftime.org/event/668/) on ctftime.
